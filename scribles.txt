Processing Unit
-----------------
- prior queues (low, medium, high)
- processes in queue (python threads?) <-- how to prevent race conditions/dead locks.
- index output devices
- index input devices
- index plugin devices

- Start new processes
- split processes into bits (multithreading) <-- threading?


Input/Output/Plugins
------
- Module based
- plugins are indexed and register as a syscall?
	--> re-indexing & regenerating the syscall table
